<p class="intro">
  Growing Devs is a shared space for a group of developers who wish to write
  about their work without the isolation that comes with a solo blog, or the
  constraints of writing only for the company you work for. Here you'll find
  content about the technology, techniques, and process the authors are using.

<section class="posts">

      <h1><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>
      <span class="author"><em>by</em> {{post.author}}</span>
